                    and the adaptation of existing settlements are no longer
                    geographically limited. The big advantage of this is that
                    creation of (new) hubs can be on much low priced land as

                  To take full advantage of these 21st century realities we
                  coined the term Global Health Cities - a global network of
                  cities that embrace the principles of decentralised healthy
                  urbanisation as mentioned above.

                <p className="font-medium">
                  As we know from previous decentralised urbanisation projects,
                  the success is not just determined by physical planning and
                  economic stimulus, but equally by community building.
                  Community building and social innovation are to be at the
                  heart of decentralised healthy urbanisation. In the last
                  century this was organized top-down and rather paternalistic.
                  Therefore we integrated the ABCD method in the Global
                  Knowledge Cities concept to address and organize cocreation
                  effectively.

                A distinctive key feature of the ABCD method is end-user driven
                co-creation: accepting that the big principles will be agreed
                and fixed but that the roles of all stakeholders are based on
                co-creation by the ABCD’s with the end-users as driving force:

                  In dynamic healthy urbanisation, as this is an investment in
                  future generations, co-creation by the ABCD’s is preferably
                  focused on younger generations taking the part of the letter
                  D. This ABCD method has proven to stimulate innovation, rather
                  than replicating established concepts of living, and ensure
                  buy-in of the younger generations who would otherwise be
                  tempted to seek their fortune in the big cities.
